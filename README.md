## 🧠 How It Works

This app uses a **content-based filtering approach**. Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

1. Loads precomputed cosine similarity values between movies.
2. When a movie is selected, finds the top 5 most similar movies.
3. Fetches posters for the recommended movies from the TMDB API.
4. Displays movie titles and their posters in a clean UI.
